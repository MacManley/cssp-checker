# Candidate Self Service Portal Checker (2025)

This program checks the status of the CSSP and whether the results are live for your given exam number. An email is sent to a gmail address once the results go live. 

I used this program for checking my 2025 Leaving Cert results and I may well have been the first person in the country to see their results.
